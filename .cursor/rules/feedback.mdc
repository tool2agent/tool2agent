To get feedback, use whichever test suite is appropriate:

- `pnpm run lint` - eslint
- `pnpm run lint:fix` - fix some lint problems
- `pnpm run build` - build sources only.
- `pnpm run build:all` - typecheck examples and tests - use when modifying the public interface-facing parts. this command does not build, only typechecks
- `pnpm run test:runtime` - slow tests, avoid
- `pnpm run test:unit` - fast sanity check tests, prefer these
- `pnpm run test:types` - API type safety checks with negative examples (via ts-expect error). run when changing API
- `pnpm run test` - run all tests, including slow runtime tests
